# Portfolio
This will be a portfolio detailing various projects in machine learning and data analysis. Most (if not all) of the projects are written in python.

### ML programming
There are a few projects here which work more on programming in python and implimenting algorithms from scratch (mostly just numpy and pandas). These are
to get a better understanding on how some of these models work under the hood as well as to practice programming.

### Data Analysis
These projects generally focus more on data manipulation and visualizations. There may or may not be some modeling being done as well.


### Kaggle Competitions
I have done the two super basic kaggle competitions on the titanic data as well as the housing dataset. These projects involve data manipulation and modeling
using sklearn.
