# Portfolio
This portfolio showcases various machine learning and data analysis projects, all of which are written in Python.

## ML Programming

The projects in this section focus on programming in Python and implementing algorithms from scratch using mostly NumPy and Pandas. These projects aim to provide a better understanding of how some of these models work under the hood, as well as to practice programming.

## Kaggle Competitions

I have completed two introductory Kaggle competitions on the Titanic and Housing datasets. Both of these competitions focused on prediction accuracy, with one being a classification task and the other a regression task. These projects involved data manipulation and modeling using Sklearn and other packages.

## Data Analysis

The projects in this section generally focus on cleaning datasets, generating simple statistics, and creating visualizations. There may or may not be some modeling being done as well.
