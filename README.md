# Portfolio
This will be a portfolio detailing various projects in machine learning and data analysis. Most (if not all) of the projects are written in python.

### ML programming
There are a few projects here which work more on programming in python and implimenting algorithms from scratch (mostly just numpy and pandas). These are
to get a better understanding on how some of these models work under the hood as well as to practice programming.

### Kaggle Competitions
I have done the two introductory kaggle competitions on the titanic data as well as the housing dataset. Both of these competitions focused on prediction accuracy one for a classification task the other regression. These projects involve data manipulation and modeling using sklearn and other packages.

### Data Analysis
These projects generally focus cleaning datasets and generation of simple statistics and visualization. There may or may not be some modeling being done as well.

### About

Hi, my name is Wil Perea I was a professor at a community college and now am working towards a career in data. I hold a MS in Biostatistics
as well as a BS in Mathematics. Otherwise I have been working on developing my programming skills and general data analysis through various online resources.
